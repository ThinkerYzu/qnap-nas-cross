Build a toolchain from srouce code to provide a cross-compiling
environment for QNAP NAS users.

This repository will build binutils, header files of Linux, glibc, and
gcc. The result sysroot will be at toolchain/ sub-directory.

== qnap-config.gz ==

You should update src/qnap-config.gz with /proc/config.gz from your
QNAP NAS.

== ports ==

There are a bunch of directories doing cross-compiling for various
packages under the ports directory. You usually just need to do

    make all && install

to install them to toolchain directory. However, you have to use
scripts/chsysroot.sh to configure executables before copying them to
the target machine. For example, if you are going to copy toolchain to
/your/native/root of the target machine. Then, you should do

    ./scripts/chsysroot.sh /your/native/root toolchain/usr/bin/mytool

if mytool is one of executables. You have to do this on all
executables since we want to have the flexibility of copying our tools
to any where on the target machine.


== Packaging ==

To make a tarball of all target binaries and libraries we have built,
you can use the following command:

    make pkg

It will create a tarball sys-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
including all binaries and libraries we have built before.
